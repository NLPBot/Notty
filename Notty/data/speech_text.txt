shows the architecture for a simple information extraction system. It begins by processing a document using several of the procedures discussed in 3 and 5.: first, the raw text of the document is split into sentences using a sentence segmenter, and each sentence is further subdivided into words using a tokenizer. Next, each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, named entity detection. In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence. Finally, we use relation detection to search for likely relations between different entities in the text.
